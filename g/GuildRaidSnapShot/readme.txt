GuildRaidSnapShot Mod
Copyright (c) 2005-2009 By DKPSystem.com
You can get the latest version of the GuildRaidSnapShot mod from

Any questions about the mod, head to the DKPSystem.com forums
or read http://www.dkpsystem.com/dynpage.php?id=17

This mod is only officially supported for DKP systems hosted on DKPSystem.com
and not supported for use with other DKP Systems (eqDKP, nDKP, etc)

You are free to make copies of this as you please, and make
changes to it as necessary to support your own DKP system (eqDKP, nDKP).

If you do, we'd be happy to hear how you've tweaked this mod to support your
particular system.

The only restriction about copying and tweaking is that credit be ALWAYS given
to DKPSystem.com in a prominent location.

The code for the "GetGRSSDKP.exe" program is found in "GetGRSSDKP.pl" a perl
program using Perl/Tk.  You'll need to get a version of perl (www.perl.org) to 
run that script in raw form.

If you wish to compile it yourself, get nmake from the following address

http://www.expertsrt.com/tutorials/Matt/perlPAR.html

Then compile it with the following line:

pp --gui -o GetGRSSDKP.exe getGRSSDKP.pl

This is also the line found in compile.bat, which is more convenient than typing that command every time.
