Lexan
By Neronix

Lexan is now an Ace2 mod! Due to the nature of Ace2 (It's a set of embedded libraries), there is no dependency! (Do note that Ace2 is currently in public beta)

Don't you hate it when you accidentally close the AH window by opening up another window?
Or maybe when you're using the bank or the mailbox, some malicious idiot opens a trade window in order to close the mail/bank windows?
Then Lexan will save your sanity!

Lexan does the following:

- Prevents other windows (e.g. social box, talents, char info) from closing the Auction House window. You can do other stuff while you buy/sell!
- Blocks trade requests when you're at the mailbox or bank, thus preventing them from closing your windows
- Prevents the world map from closing all your windows

Released under the GPL

AH window protector based on code from Auctioneer

Special thanks to all the people in #Wowace and some people on Hellscream EU who helped test the trade blocker.
