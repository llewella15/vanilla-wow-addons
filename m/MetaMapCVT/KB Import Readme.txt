DESCRIPTION:
============
This is an addon for MetaMap that will populate your Metamap Knowledge Base with the locations and info on over 5000 Mobs and NPCS.

TO DO:
======
While my database does have information on well over 5000 mobs and npcs most of them were gathered with wowkb. 
As such many do not contain the mob level data and/or discription. In the near future i will go back and visit those mobs so that MetaMap KB can obtain that information.

CREDITS:
========
MetaMap was created by Urshurak.
Maps for MetaMap obtained from WoW Cartographe. An excellent WoW desktop map program.
French localisation for MetaMap by Halrik.
German localisation For MetaMap by oneofamillion.
MapNotes code integrated into MetaMap by kind permission of the author.
Original WoWKB code by ciphersimian.

INSTALLATION:
=============
Simply follow the three simple steps below.

1. Copy the MetaMapCVT Folder to your \interface\addons folder

For most of you the location of your addons directory would be C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\

2. Log into World of Warcraft and open MetaMap, then open extended options and click on the import tab. then click on the Load Imports button and click on the import button for User KB File.

3. Now launch the MetaMap Knowledge Base and you will have access to a wealth of new information on over 5000+ mob's and npc's

Note, that it will NOT import any entries which already exist

*****NOTE*****
This could not have been made possible without the work that Urshurak has done in making such a great addon.
