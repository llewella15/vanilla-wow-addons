Thanks to: Awen for the original Spell Alert
           cide (a genius) for some useful code snippets =D

Version 1.65

This Addon is a modification of the original Spell Alert by Awen.
SpellAlert warns the user of what the target is casting.

Use /spellalert to open the options window.

Feedback is VERY much appreciated.  So feel free to post any bugs or suggestions.
If you encounter any spells that I need to add to the spell list, please tell me.
If I said that I fixed a bug but it turns out I didn't really fix it... 
Please tell me! =D

Changes:

1.65
 -Improved dragging of the alert.

1.6
 -Fixed hunter retargetting! Woot!
 -Re-added Living Bomb warning. (Stupid MC lockout >_<! Let
  me know if it doesn't actually work =P)
 -Added option to change the delay time before fading out.

1.51
 -Fixed silly typos that caused some options to not work.
 -Renamed "alert emotes" to "alert npc emotes"
 -There are some spells that are not listed in the
  localization thus making some
  options to turn off specific alerts to "seem" like they are
  not working.
 -TODO: Fix Hunter retargetting.
        Perhaps re-add Living Bomb warnings etc.
        Add other spells to the localizations.
 -REMEMBER: Feedback is VERY much appreciated.  So feel free
  to post any bugs orsuggestions.  If you encounter any spells
  that I need to add to the spell list, please tell me.  If I 
  said that I fixed a bug but it turns out I didn't really
  fix it... please tell me! =D

1.5
 -Updated TOC to 10900.
 -Options frame is now draggable... yay!
 -Changed the layout of the options panel.. because it's THAT important. =D
 -Fixed some typos, clarified some stuff with tooltips.
 -Added the option to change the border thickness of the alerts.
 -A reset button.. for people who like defaults!
 -As requested, the alert may now be dragged for the hardcore customizers' needs.
 -TODO: Fix known bugs.

1.4
 -Fixed A LOT of stupid typos and mistakes >_<
 -Added ability to set whether you want the whole message,
  just the spell name, or everything but the spell name colored.
 -Colors no longer "reset" when opening the options window.
 -Changed font to something less beefy, pixelation should no longer occur on
  size changing.  I plan on adding an option to set whether the text is bold
  like before, or streamline like it is now.
