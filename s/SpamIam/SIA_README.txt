Playing WoW involves the 'spamming' of certain actions.  Unfortunately the game does not like 'button mashing' and lets you know it, by printing a text message on screen or by an audible speech message.  "That Ability is not ready yet", "I can't do that yet", etc etc.

Features changed from RogueSpam 1.5:
--> Added new filters
--> Added Speech options
--> Other minor modifications
