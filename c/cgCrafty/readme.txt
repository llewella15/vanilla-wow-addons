There are a lot of different mods out there that have similar functionality, 
but they all either add too many features or don't have the right one. If you're 
looking to add a simple search to your tradeskill/crafting windows, cgCrafty should 
fit that niche perfectly.

cgCrafty offers search functionality to your crafting/tradeskill windows in a 
lightweight, unobtrusive way. The mod will add a small window attached to the 
bottom of the currently open crafting/tradeskill window. As of version 2.0, you
may also link the required reagents/materials required in order to construct/craft
the selected item to chat. cgCrafty will not hook into or capture any events until 
you've actually opened either of the crafting or tradeskill windows. It is written 
for speed, efficiency and most of all, usability.

To turn off the mod, check out the slash commands: /cgc or /cgcrafty 

Leave a message for me in the comments or at WoWInterface bug 
report if you have any issues / ideas / updates / etc. to share with
me.

TO INSTALL: Put the cgCrafty folder into
	\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\

This mod runs using the embedded Ace2 library.  What that means is that you do not
have to install any third hand libraries in order to get cgCrafty to work; it just
will.  If you have other Ace2 mods installed, they should play nice.
