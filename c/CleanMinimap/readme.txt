    This mod provides total control over your Minimap including moving it and resizing it (by
    holding down a modifier key, while clicking the Minimap), hiding the titlebar (and [X] button), 
    the + and - zoom buttons and the daytime/clock button and adding the three other compass 
    points (S,E and W). 
    
    This mod allows you to zoom the minimap using the mouse wheel and to affect the opacity of 
    the minimap by holding down the (configurable) "modifier" key (default SHIFT) and scrolling the mouse wheel.

    You can also have the minimap toggle between large, normal, and small sizes with a single keypress 
    and last, but not least, you can specify the positions of the Blizzard standard Minimap 
    icons, such as the "New Mail" icon, around the circumference of the Minimap.
