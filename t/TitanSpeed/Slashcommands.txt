/newspeedrate ( /nsr )
-This sets a new speedrate for the current zone based on your current speed which should be 100%,
 meaning, if you want a new rate, start running in 100% (no mount, no aspect, no enchants, no sprint etc)
 and type /nsr or /newspeedrate. This should fix any wierd numbers in that current zone.
 Note: The altered rates are character-individual.

/resetspeedrates ( /rsr )
-If you screw up, like setting a rate to 0, this command will reset all rates to standard ones.
