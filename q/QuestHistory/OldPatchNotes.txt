OLDER PATCH NOTES and Description Text


	Assumptions:		Title of quest in QuestFrameRewardPanel is the same as the title that
						displays in the QuestLog
							- If this assumption is wrong, the quest will not be marked
							  completed and instead, a new quest will be logged.

						A quest cannot be accepted again after it has been successfully
						completed
							- This assumption is not correct for all quests. QuestHistory uses
							  the quest title and description to distinguish between different
							  quests. If the same quest is accepted again, the addon will not
							  recognize it as new and will instead just update the data for
							  the old instance of the quest. This problem will not affect
							  quests that are never actually accepted (i.e. ones that never
							  show up in the game's Quest Log).

						The QuestRewardCompleteButton_OnClick function is always called when a
						quest is completed - player must click on Complete button or game does
						not register quest as complete
							- If this assumption is wrong, some quests may be completed that
							  the addon will not catch. This would mean that the quests would
							  not be marked completed.

						Only one quest can be fully completed at a time (i.e. clicking one
						time on the Complete button will never complete 2 quests)
							- QuestHistory only keeps track of the last quest that was completed
							  for purposes of updating completion data such as XP reward,
							  completed location, etc. If two quests can be completed at once,
							  QuestHistory will only update one of them.

						The NPC that gives or completes a quest is always targeted when the
						player accepts/completes a quest
							- If this assumption is wrong, then the data stored for Quest Giver
							  and Quest Completer could be wrong.

						Description of quest when accepted is the same as description shown in
						QuestLog
							- If this assumption is wrong, QuestHistory will not always
							  recognize which quest was the most recently accepted. Thus some
							  accepted data will not be recorded (i.e. Quest Giver, accepted
							  time, etc.).


	Version History:
		2.71	- Removed the 0,0 traps, as I've only received reports of 0,0's inside instances since adding the traps.
				  Since instances are ALWAYS going to be 0,0, we are going to assume that things are kosher at the moment.
					
		2.7	- Changed Unknown Entity search string to global (so all languages should be covered) [Thanks, Asjaskan]
				- Now strips any third-party quest level-adding addon text from the titles [Thanks, Asjaskan]
				- Added new trap for 0,0 coordinate bug. Please report any codes you might see!
				- Added possible 0,0 fix, using a WorldMap show/hide cycler.
				- Finally fixed the delay on subsequent accepted quests (speed-accept bug).
				- Fixed errors that occurred upon login if you weren't an existing QH user.
				- Updated to TOC 1800.
				
		2.6     - Fixed Unknown Entity bug, and updated for Patch 1700 (by Dsanai)
				  If this version doesn't work, don't blame Jasters.
				
		2.52	- Changed some code so that the LogCurrentQuests function is allowed to run
				  more frequently. This should resolve the problem where some data wasn't
				  being recorded.

				- Fixed the US version from loading the French localization.

		2.51	- Fixed a problem where some old data was not being upgraded to the new format.
				  This should resolve the errors with the repair function as well.

				- Added some checks to the repair function so that it won't fail if it
				  encounters unknown data.

				- Added some new strings to the French and German localizations. (Thanks Juki
				  and Maischter!)

		2.50	- Updated to work with the 1.3.1 WoW patch (1300).

				- Changed the way data is stored to reduce the size of QuestHistory's portion
				  of SavedVariables.lua.

				- Added the ability to view the quests for characters other than the currently
				  logged-in one.

				- Changed the colors of the displayed quests so that current quests will show
				  the difficulty color and added the ability to select colors for abandoned
				  and completed quests.

				- Added the ability to edit and delete quests. By default, these abilities are
				  inactive, but they can be turned on in the Options window. Then right-clicking
				  on a quest will edit it and shift-right-clicking on a quest will delete it.

				- Added the ability to manually add a quest.

				- Added a delete character button that will completely remove a character's
				  history. This cannot be used on the currently logged-in character.

				- Added a repair function that will attempt to repair quest data. This can
				  sometimes resolve "nil" errors. Also, this can be used to remove duplicate
				  quests and "Port to Auberdine/Menethil" quests.

				- Added an option to stop logging "Port to Auberdine/Menethil" quests. This
				  option is enabled by default.

				- Modified the hooked version of the QuestRewardCompleteButton_OnClick function
				  so that duplicate quests should not be recorded.

				- Added French and German translations from Juki and Tenvans. Thanks!

				- Fixed the anchoring of the "Next" button in QuestHistoryDetailFrame.

		2.0.2	- Updated to work with the 1.2.3 WoW patch (4211).

		2.0.1	- Modified the hooked version of the QuestRewardCompleteButton_OnClick function
				  to get the time completed before calling the original function. This should
				  ensure that the time completed is recorded correctly without causing a nil
				  error.

				- Fixed a bug that would sometimes prevent quest XP from being recorded.

		2.0		- Added code to prevent logging function from being run too many times
				  in a short period of time. This should resolve the lockup issue.

				- Added an options window that gives the user control over which types
				  of quests are displayed (abandoned, completed or current) in the list.

				- Added options for choosing what quest data is logged. This can be used
				  to reduce the size of QuestHistory's portion of SavedVariables.lua.

				- Added some hooks to MapNotes to allow creation of map notes for quest NPC
				  locations. This additional functionality only works if MapNotes is also
				  installed, but MapNotes is in no way necessary for the rest of the addon
				  to work as expected.

				- Added some simple search functionality to filter quests by inputted text.

				- Changed the way the sort by completed order works so that abandoned
				  quests are grouped together.

				- Changed some of the displays to work better with 1024x768 resolutions.

				- Added code to resolve the known nil errors. Also added more code to
				  hopefully prevent future ones from occurring.

				- Reworked some of the functions and added more commenting.

				- Rewrote much of the XML code and broke it up into separate files.


		1.2.1	- Fixed annoying bug preventing QuestHistory from loading when using a
				  character that had no prior quest history from a previous version.


		1.2		- Fixed spell rewards not displaying correctly. The spell name and
				  texture now show correctly but the tooltip is still not working.
				  This is because the GetQuestItemLink() function does not seem to
				  work with spell rewards.

				- Changed how failed quests are determined. Hopefully, this will fix
				  the problem of quests not being marked failed.

				- Added logging of played time when quest is accepted/completed.

				- Added tooltips to display quest notes when hovering over quests in list.

				- Rewrote and reorganized some functions to streamline processing and make
				  the code simpler.


		1.1.1	- Updated to work with the 1.2.1 WoW patch (4150).


		1.1		- Fixed display of objectives in detail view so that they still show
			  	  as completed after the quest is completed.

				- Fixed some of the sort functions which were not working correctly.

				- Fixed an error that could occur if a quest was completed without
				  ever having been accepted. This could occur if the quest giver and
				  quest completer were the same and the player had already completed
				  all the objectives before first talking to the NPC.

				- Rewrote the function hooks so that if an error occurs in the
				  QuestHistory script, the game will still continue.

				- Added more error-checking to functions to eliminate some if not all
				  nil errors.


		1.0		Initial Release
