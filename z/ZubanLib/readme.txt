ZubanLib - by Zuban (chumpnet@hotmail.com)

VERSION
	0.1.2 - 27 Mar 2005

DESCRIPTION
	Library functions used by various addons.

	I will try to make sure that all addons that use this library are
	compatible with the latest version of this library regardless of the
	version of the individual addons. In the event that the library breaks
	an individual addon, I will release a new version of that addon.

INSTRUCTIONS
	Copy the ZubanLib folder into the following folder on your
	machine (create the necessary folders if they do not exist):
		...\World of Warcraft\Data\Interface\Addons\
		
	If you already have a version of the ZubanLib addon installed, verify
	that this copy is a newer version. Keep the latest version.
